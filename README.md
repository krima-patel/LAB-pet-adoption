Pet Adoption is a project allowing users to view available pets for adoption. 

## Primary Features

Users are able to view the pets up for adoption, place a pet for adoption, and delete the pet from the directory. 

## Target Audience

Pet Adoption is a fun adoption site for anyone to view and experience. Users will find pets of various types, ranging from sweet furry friends like dogs and cats to... some interesting ones like dinosaurs.

## Purpose

Pet Adoption is designed to allow users to view available pets, create a pet for adoption by filing out a form, and deleting the pet if not available for adoption.
